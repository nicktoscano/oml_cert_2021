### Oracle Machine Learning Features:
* Use Oracle Database as an HPC environment
* Use in-database parallelized and distributed ML algorithms
* Run Python user-defined functions in database-spawned Python engines
* Store Python objects and user-defined functions in the database
* Use automated machine learning (AutoML) and model explainability (MLX)

### Machine Learning Vs. Oracle Machine Learning

### Oracle Machine Learning Algorithm Categories
* Classification
* Clustering
* Time Series
* Association Rules
* SQL Analytics
* Predictive Queries
* Anomaly Detection

### Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4PY):
* Develop, refine, and deploy user-defined Python functions and machine learning models
* Run overloaded Python functions and use native Python syntax to manipulate in-database data
* Use Automated Machine Learning to enhance user productivity and machine learning results
* Use embedded Python execution to run user-defined Python functions in Python engines spawned and managed by the database environment

### Python Libraries Included with OML4PY on ADB:
* cx_Oracle 
* pyparsing
* python-dateuti
* joblib
* kiwisolver
* pytz
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* threapoolctl

### Advantages:
* Save and mange Python objects using the OML4PY data store
* Run user-defined Python functions in database-spawned and controlled Python engines
* Leverage additional Python packages to compliment in-database functionality through embedded Python execution
* Operate on database data from Python without using SQL
* Minimize data movement
* Keep data secure
* Score data directly in the database
* Automate common machine learning tasks
