## Introduction:

To pass the Oracle Machine Learning certification, you may need to understand the user personas. Oracle uses the term permission types to define types of users. Permission types allow users to perform different tasks in the workspace, projects, and notebooks. There are three permission types on Oracle Machine Learning. Each permission type can interact with four resources differently: project, workspace, notebooks, and jobs.

Abilities of Each Permission Type:
Permission types include manager, developer, and viewer.
A manager can:

*	Project: Create, update, view and delete.
*	Workspace: View only.
*	Notebooks: Create, update, duplicate, run, export, import, and delete.
*	Jobs: Schedule and run jobs.

A developer can:

* Project: View only.
* Workspace: View only.
*	Notebooks: Create, update, run, duplicate, import, export, and delete notebooks.
* Jobs: View and run jobs of shared notebooks only.

A viewer can:

* Project: View only
* Workspace: View only
* Notebooks: View only
* Jobs: View jobs and job runs of shared notebooks only

## Sample Questions:
Here are some example questions for this information that may be representative of the type of questions on the exam:
Question: Which three types of permissions can be granted to a user to collaborate and access a workspace in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks
Answer: Manager, Developer, Viewer
Question: Which task is not related to Developer?
Answer: Reassign user workspace

## The Administrator Role:
An administrator manages users and resources. Functions include creating, editing, and deleting user accounts, as well as; reassigning user workspaces. An administrator is not authorized to run notebooks.

In summary the admin really does 3 things:
*	Manages users
*	Manages user data
*	Manages compute resource

## Sample Questions:
Here are some example questions for this information that may be representative of the type of questions on the exam:
Question: Which role can access the User Management interface?
Answer: Administrator
Question: Which two can be performed by an Administrator in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks?
Answer: Reassign user workspace, View notebooks in read-only mode
